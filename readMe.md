1.Repository creation
The first stage of the SCM life cycle involves creating a repository to store the source code. This is where all the code related to the project will be stored and managed. The repository can be created on a local machine or on a cloud-based platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Example: Create a new repository on GitHub for a collaborative software development project.

2. Code commits
Once the repository is created, developers can start adding their code to it. Each set of changes made to the code is called a commit. Commits are cheap and easy to make, so developers should make them frequently to capture updates to the code base. Each commit should be accompanied by a descriptive message that explains what changes were made.

Example: Commit changes to a file that implements a new feature for the project. In the commit message, describe the purpose and functionality of the new feature.

3. Branching
As the project progresses, developers may need to work on different features or fixes independently. This is where branching comes in. Branching allows developers to create a separate line of development for a specific feature or fix. This way, multiple developers can work on different features without interfering with each other.

Example: Create a new branch for a new feature that requires a large amount of code changes. This allows the developer to work on the new feature without affecting the main codebase.

4. Merging
Once a branch is ready for integration with the main codebase, it needs to be merged. Merging involves combining the changes from the branch with the main codebase. If there are any conflicts between the two sets of code, they will need to be resolved before the merge can be completed.

Example: Merge the new feature branch into the main codebase. If there are any conflicts, resolve them and complete the merge.

5. Pull requests
Before a branch is merged into the main codebase, it's common to create a pull request. A pull request is a formal request to merge the changes from the branch into the main codebase. This allows other developers to review the changes before they are merged.

Example: Create a pull request for the new feature branch. Ask other developers to review the changes and provide feedback.

6. Code review
The code review stage is where other developers review the changes made in the pull request. They can suggest improvements, identify potential bugs, and ensure that the code meets the project's standards. Code review is an essential step in ensuring that the code is high-quality and maintainable.

Example: Review the code changes in the pull request for the new feature branch. Provide feedback and suggestions for improvements.

7. Pull request merging
Once the code review is complete, the pull request can be merged into the main codebase. This is the final step in the SCM life cycle.

Example: Merge the pull request for the new feature branch into the main codebase.


The main reason sets data structure is not a good data structure for this scenario:
In the scenario, we need to keep track of the number of times each political party has a specific number of registered members, which requires a data structure that can store both the values and their frequencies. Sets cannot store frequency information, so it won't be possible to extract the information required for the scenario.

A better data structure for this scenario would be a dictionary, where keys represent the number of registered members and values represent the number of political parties with that many registered members. This would allow for efficient storage and retrieval of the information needed.
